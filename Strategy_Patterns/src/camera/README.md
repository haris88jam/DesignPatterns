Primitive photo app using the strategy pattern. 

The idea is that the .save() and .take() functions are the same in every photo taking app. 

.Edit() depends on the app (basic or pro)

.Share() is handled through and interface and it allows user to share through the standard channels(text, email, social media etc.)
